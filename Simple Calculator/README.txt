12/20/2018 v0.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Updated:
-Combined two Python files into one.

Unsolved:
-None. I think I won't do any further update on this project after that.

12/15/2018 v0.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Updated:
-Background color, button color, and display color are updated.
-The display will only show numbers you input after the last non-number character (it used to show the whole math expression including compute signs).
-Numbers are no longer located in the middle of the display; they will start from right side.
-When you input numbers after you get an outcome by clicking '=' button, they will no longer simply append to the outcome but will start a new computation.
-You can now start computation with '-' without 'Erro!'.
